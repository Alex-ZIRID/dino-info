ü¶ñ Dino Infographic Project

**Description**

The Dino Infographic Project is an interactive web application that compares a user‚Äôs height, weight, and dietary preferences with various dinosaurs. It uses a dynamic grid to display a combination of comparison facts and static facts about the dinosaurs.

The user can input their data, select between imperial (lbs, feet, inches) or metric (kg, cm) units, and generate a fun comparison infographic.

**Features**

1. Unit Selection: Imperial or Metric

	‚Ä¢	Users can choose between Imperial or Metric units for their input.

	‚Ä¢	Imperial: Weight (lbs), Height (feet and inches).

	‚Ä¢	Metric: Weight (kg), Height (cm).


The app seamlessly handles the unit conversion to ensure accurate comparisons.

2. Randomized Comparison vs Static Facts
	‚Ä¢	The grid displays 9 tiles:

	‚Ä¢	5 tiles show randomized comparisons between the user‚Äôs data and dinosaur attributes. Examples include comparisons of weight, height, and diet.

	‚Ä¢	2 tiles display static dinosaur facts (e.g., ‚ÄúThe Triceratops lived during the Late Cretaceous period.‚Äù).

	‚Ä¢	The Pigeon tile always displays a fun fact: ‚ÄúAll birds are dinosaurs.‚Äù


The comparisons and facts are randomly distributed for each session to keep the results engaging.
